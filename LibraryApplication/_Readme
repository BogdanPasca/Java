This program is like a library system management. We have albums and novels. 
- albums have name  number of pages and paper quality  
- novels have name  number of pages  and type (like mister, drama, romance etc). 
- novels and albums are stored in an arrayList. 
- we can add novels and books to the list, we can print/list them out individually or like total( albums + novels).
- we can delete from the list a specific novel or album.
- when we list them we can see all of their properties.
