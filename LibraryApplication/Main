/**
 * <p>This program is like a library system management. We have albums and novels. Albums have <b> name </b>, <b> number of pages</b>
 * and <b>paper quality </b> and novels have <b> name </b>, <b> number of pages </b> and <b>type</b> (like mister, drama, romance etc). </p>
 * <p> Novels and albums are stored in an <b>arrayList</b>. We can add novels and books to the list, we can print/list them out individually or like total( albums + novels).
 * We can delete from the list a specific novel or album.
 * When we list them we can see all of their properties.</p>
